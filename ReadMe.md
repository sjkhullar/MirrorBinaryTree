The Binary tree where every child nodes of a node interchanged is called mirror binary tree.

We can go through the complete code. We have created 3 packages

1.) org.learn.PrepareTree : Under this package we are creating the tree and printing the binary tree. We have following classes in this package.

	Tree : This class is used to create and print binary tree.
	Node: This class represent the node of binary tree.
2.) org.learn.Question: Under this question package, we will have MirrorTree class, which is responsible for preparing the mirror binary tree.

3.) org.learn.Client: Under this package we have main function.
	We are calling insert method to prepare binary tree
	We are calling printTree method to print the binary tree
	We will be calling mirrorTree of Mirror class to prepare mirror binary tree.
